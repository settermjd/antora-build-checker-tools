= Using occ apps commands

This command reference covers the ownCloud maintained apps commands.

ownCloud’s `occ` command (ownCloud console) is ownCloud’s command-line interface.
You can perform common server operations with `occ`, including installing and upgrading ownCloud, managing users and groups, encryption, passwords, and LDAP setting.

`occ` is in the owncloud/ directory; for example /var/www/owncloud on Ubuntu Linux. `occ` is a PHP script.
*You must run it as your HTTP user* to ensure that your ownCloud files and directories retain the correct permissions.

[[run-occ-as-your-http-user]]
== Run occ As Your HTTP User

The HTTP user is different on the various Linux distributions.
See strong_perms_label to learn how to find your HTTP user.

* The HTTP user and group in Debian/Ubuntu is www-data.
* The HTTP user and group in Fedora/CentOS is apache.
* The HTTP user and group in Arch Linux is http.
* The HTTP user in openSUSE is wwwrun, and the HTTP group is www.

If your HTTP server is configured to use a different PHP version than the default (/usr/bin/php), `occ` should be run with the same version.
For example, in CentOS 6.5 with SCL-PHP54 installed, the command looks like this:

....
sudo -u apache /opt/rh/php54/root/usr/bin/php /var/www/html/owncloud/occ
....

The following examples are based on Ubuntu.

Running `occ` with no options lists all commands and options

....
